What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
My initial thinking was that unit testing could be extremely beneficial, especially in ensuring that each part of my code works correctly before compiling the entire program

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


What worked:  I made an effort to write tests for all the classes, which helped me focus on the individual functionality of each part of the program. This approach made me more aware of the structure and behavior of my code.

What didn't: 
owever, I encountered errors in nearly every line of my tests, which was frustrating. Iâ€™m unsure whether the issues stem from mistakes in my code or from problems within the train assignment itself. Despite this, I plan to submit my work for now, because it is past deadline. Once I have some breathing room over the break, I will revisit the tests and work through them at a steady pace, without the pressure of deadlines, and then resubmit once I've made improvements.


Advice:
Start Small.
